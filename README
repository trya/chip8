Yet another CHIP-8 VM implementation
====================================
by trya - tryagainprod@gmail.com

Some peculiarities:
-------------------
- modular and exposing an API to easily reimplement the frontend in
pretty much any language or environment possible.
- core of the VM is written in C99-compliant C.
- SDL frontend is also written in C, but can only compile on Linux at
the moment, as it uses the Linux-specific timerfd for timer operations
- the interpreter does not limitate the number of instructions per
second, so it's up to the frontend to make the interpreter wait during
keyboard or display operations. For example, the SDL frontend waits
either on vsync or keyboard event.

Build instructions:
-------------------
$ make
- binaries will be put in bin/ in the project directory.
Other targets:
- clean: remove binaries and object files
- debug: build binaries with debug symbols (make sure to clean before)
- chip8_dummy: build dummy executable without any interface (video,
audio, keyboard, timers) implemented
- chip8_sdl: SDL frontend
